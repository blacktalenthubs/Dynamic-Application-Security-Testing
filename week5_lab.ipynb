        "### Step 3: Visualize Data in Kibana\n",
        "- Navigate to `Discover` to explore your log data.\n",
        "- Create visualizations and dashboards:\n",
        "  - Navigate to `Visualize` to create visualizations.\n",

        "- Use dashboards to monitor real-time data and identify potential security incidents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Incident Analysis\n",
        "- Demonstrate how to drill down into specific logs to analyze incidents.\n",
        "- Use filters and search queries in Kibana to isolate relevant log entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Incident Response\n",
        "- Teach how to respond to incidents based on the analysis.\n",
        "- Discuss steps like isolating affected systems, mitigating attacks, and collecting forensic evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Reporting and Documentation\n",
        "- Show how to generate reports from Kibana dashboards.\n",
        "- Discuss the importance of documenting incidents and response actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Scenario: Brute Force Attack Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Simulate Brute Force Attack\n",
        "- Use Hydra to simulate an SSH brute force attack as shown above.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Collect Logs\n",
        "- Ensure Filebeat is collecting SSH logs (usually located in `/var/log/auth.log`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Create Visualization in Kibana\n",
        "- In Kibana, create a line chart to show failed login attempts over time.\n",
        "- Use the following steps:\n",
        "  - Navigate to `Visualize` > `Create Visualization` > `Line`.\n",
        "  - Select the `filebeat-*` index pattern.\n",
        "  - Configure the X-axis with a date histogram of the timestamp.\n",
        "  - Configure the Y-axis with a count of failed login attempts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Analyze and Respond\n",
        "- Show the spike in failed login attempts on the Kibana dashboard.\n",
        "- Discuss response strategies, such as blocking the attacking IP, enhancing password policies, and setting up alerts for similar patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "By following this setup guide, you will create a practical, hands-on environment for teaching incident response using the ELK Stack. Students will gain experience in detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents, which is essential for cybersecurity professionals."
